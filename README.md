# MEDS
## Matrix Equivalence Digital Signature

This repository provides the reference implementation of the PQC signature scheme MEDS
as submitted to the NIST PQC Signature standardization process.

The website accompanying the MEDS submission is [meds-pqc.org](https://www.meds-pqc.org/).

The submission document with the MEDS specification can be found [here](https://www.meds-pqc.org/spec/MEDS-2023-05-31.pdf).

## Compile

The reference implementation in directory `/ref` can be compiled
using the provided Makefile.

We provide three programs:
`test` to run at test of key generation, signing, and verification,
`bench` for benchmarking the implementation using several rounds, and
`KAT_test` for computing known answer tests.

The test can be compiled and run by

`make RUN`

the benchmark using

`make BENCH`

and the KAT test using

`make KAT`.

The default parameter set is the `toy` parameter set. Another parameter set can be selected using `PARAM`, e.g.:

`make RUN PARAM=MEDS9923`.

A list of available parameter sets can be obtained by:

`./params.py -l`.

To run all targets, add `_ALL` to `RUN`, `BENCH`, and `KAT`, e.g.:

`make RUN_ALL`.

When the code is compiled with `DEBUG` defined, exhaustive step-by-step debugging is produced and written to `stderr`.

The code package of the MEDS NIST submission with dedicated directories for each parameter set can be generated by

`./NIST.sh`.
