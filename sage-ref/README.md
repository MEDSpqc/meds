The Sage script requires PyCryptodome for SHAKE as well as bitstream.

Install by:

```console
   sage --pip install PyCryptodome bitstream
```

A toy example of MEDS can be run using the following command:

```console
   sage MEDS.sage
```

A list of the MEDS instances for the parameter set can be obtained with the following command:

```console
   python MEDS.sage -l
```

A specific parameter set can be run by:

```console
   sage MEDS.sage [PARAMETER SET]
```

Tested with SageMath version 9.6.

The Python code files require Python version 3.8 or newer.
